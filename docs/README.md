Heroku link (make this an actual link by Tuesday COB)


MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT
Greatreads is a web application inspired on Goodreads built using Ruby on Rails and React/Redux. By the end of Week 9, this app will, at a minimum, satsify the following criteria with smooth, bug-free navigation, adequate seed data and sufficient CSS styling:
  1. New account creation, login, and guest/demo login
  2. A production README
  3. Hosting on Heroku
  4. Books
  5. Bookshelves
  6. Read Status (to-read, read, current-reading, etc.)
  7. Reviews
  8. Bonus: Search
    -If the book is not included, the search results page will have a link to add the book, just as Goodreads has (the create book link is only provided if you don't get any search results)
  9. Bonus: lists and tags
